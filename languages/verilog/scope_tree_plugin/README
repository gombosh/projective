To enable the "print_scope_tree" plug-in in SimVision, set the 
following environment variable before running SimVision or irun...

setenv SIMVISIONOPTS " -memberplugindir <location of this directory>"

A "print_scope_tree" command will be added to the SimVision Tcl interpreter.
Usage of this command is:
   print_scope_tree -file <filename> -include cells -source -abrevgenerate
                    -flat -ignoremod mod1 mod2... -nodecendmod mod1 mod2...

Options:
   -file <filename>     Output is written specified file.  (If not provided,
                          default output file is "scope_tree.txt".)
   -include cells       Include gates/cells in output.  (Including those
                          specified by simulator "-y" option.)
   -source              Include source file of each module in output.  (Note
                          that the simulation snapshot must be loaded in 
                          order for the source information to be available.)
   -abrevgenerate       Report only one instance for a generate.
   -flat                Report flat instead of tree style output.
   -ignoremod mod1...   Instances with a provided module name will not be 
                          reported, nor will their child instances.
                          (Module names can include wildcard patterns.)
   -nodecendmod mod1... Child instances and below of instances with a 
                          provided module name will not be reported.
                          (Module names can include wildcard patterns.)

You can invoke this command as follows from the SimVision tab of the
Console window, for example:

print_scope_tree -file scope_tree.txt -source


!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

PLEASE NOTE:  Setting SIMVISIONOPTS will override the location where
SimVision loads member plug-ins, so no other member plug-ins (ISX, TXE,
CtoS, etc...) will be loaded when this environment variable is set.

To workaround this, you can create links from the directory containing
the SimVision member plug-ins in the installation to this directory.
To do this, assuming you cd to the directory of this plug-in...

ln -s <INSTALL>/tools.lnx86/simvision/plugins/{*.so,*.cph} .
ln -s <INSTALL>/tools.lnx86/simvision/plugins/64bit/{*.so,*.cph} ./64bit/.
